# kinematics_toolbox
The Matlab "3D-Kinematics" toolbox is a library for scientific data analysis, with a focus on 3d kinematics.

It ontains the following routines:

## Analysis for IMU-recordings

    * calculation of orientation from velocity, recorded with IMUs or space-fixed systems (four different algorithms are implemente here:
        - simple quaternion integration
        - a quaternion Kalman filter
        - Madgwick’s algorithm
        - Mahony’s algorithm
    * calculation of position and orientation from IMU-signals
    * The sub-directory sensors contains utility to import in data from xio, XSens, and yei system

### Analysis routines for 3D movements from marker-based video recordings
    * a function that takes recordings from video-systems (e.g. Optotrak) and calculates position and orientation
    * calculation of joint movements from marker recordings

Functions for working with quaternions

    * quaternion multiplication, inversion, conjugate
    * conversions to rotation matrices, axis angles, vectors
    * a Quaternion class, including operator overloading for multiplication and division
    * also work on data arrays

Functions for working with rotation matrices

    * rotation matrices for rotations about the x-, y-, and z-axis
    * symbolic rotation matrices
    * conversions to Euler, Fick, Helmholtz angles

Functions for working with vectors

    * angle between vectors
    * Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
    * projection
    * normalization
    * rotation
    * also work on data arrays

Visualization of time-series data, and of 3D orientations
